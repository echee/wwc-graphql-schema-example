## Purpose

This repo is for a codesandbox that demonstrates how to write a GraphQL Schema.

It goes over:

- Scalar Types
- Object Types
- Validation Types/ nullable and non nullable
- Enum Types
- Interface Types

`index.js` will be the only file that gets loaded, copy the code from the other `index.step<number>.js` files and paste it into `index.js` to see it run
